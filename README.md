# MAP-Generation-from-Satellite-Images-using-Pix2Pix-GAN
This repository explores the use of a Pix2Pix GAN for image translation between satellite images and corresponding maps. The trained model can generate realistic maps from input satellite imagery, demonstrating the potential for this technique in applications such as urban planning and geographic information systems.
